# Python Course
This course is intended to allow you to understand the fundamentals of python and working with it on a local environment up to the point of at least building mini-apps that run in the command line. SO first of all we start with the CLI and work our way through basic programming terminology, Python itself, data types, functions, files, exception handling all the way to classes and objects in Python

## CLI
The command line interface is an alternative way to the GUI which allows us to manipulate the computer. The GUI uses graphics; images, gestures, text, etc. whereas the command line basically uses commands. So they do the same thing but in different ways. CLI might give you more or easier access to deeper functionality from what I know, at least. 

### Terminal
For a GUI, to issue commands you would primarily use the mouse buttons or the keyboard. For the CLI, you'd have to literally type out whatever you want to the computer to do for you. These are called commands. The CLI can be accessed via programs called terminals (or shell or console). Examples of terminals are
- Command Prompt
- Power Shell
- Terminal
- Termux

For this tutorial we'll be using Command Prompt and then maybe Power Shell. So let's launch CMD which is short for command prompt.

### Path
When you open Command Prompt you realize that there's some blinking underscore. Yes, that's the cursor. It indicates where you type your commands. 

Before the cursor, there's something like:
```shell
C:\Users\user>
```
That is called the path. The path is telling you the folder in which you have opened the terminal. So right now we are in a folder called `user`. And `user` is a subfolder of the `Users` folder. `C` is the name of our drive (drive letter) that's why it ends with a colon "`:`". 

<!-- TODO --> So let's open the file explorer and see if we can go to the same location that we are in in our terminal. 

<!-- TODO  --> Open the file explorer and show the path in the address bar too.

### Files
A file is basically a resource for recording data. The file can be an executable, meaning it can be run, like a game or a software installation. It can also be a video, a Word document, audio, or picture.

### Directory
A directory is like a container where you can store your files on your PC.
